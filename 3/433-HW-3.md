## 13.4.6 Exercises

### 1. Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:

``` r
avg_dest_delays <-
  flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  inner_join(airports, by = c(dest = "faa"))


avg_dest_delays %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat, colour = delay)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point() +
  coord_quickmap()
```

### 2.Add the location of the origin and destination (i.e. the lat and lon) to flights.

``` r
airport_locations <- airports %>%
  select(faa, lat, lon)

flights %>%
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest) %>%
  left_join(
    airport_locations,
    by = c("origin" = "faa")
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    airport_locations,
    by = c("dest" = "faa"),
    suffix = c("_origin", "_dest")
  )
```

### 3.Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

``` r
planes_new<-planes %>% 
  select(tailnum,plane_year=year)
plane_new <-
  flights %>% 
  inner_join(planes_new,by="tailnum") %>% 
  mutate(age=year-plane_year) %>% 
   group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(
    dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep_delay_sd = sd(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    arr_delay_mean = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    arr_delay_sd = sd(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_arr_delay = sum(!is.na(arr_delay)),
    n_dep_delay = sum(!is.na(dep_delay))
  )
```

-   This question doesn’t mention whether is the departure delay or the
    arrival delay, so we need to check the two kinds of delay:

-   For the departure delay, we make the scatter plot of the
    relationship between the planes’ age and the departure delay. From
    the plot, we can find that the average departure delay is increasing
    for planes with ages up until 10 years. After that the departure
    delay decreases or levels off.

``` r
ggplot(plane_new, aes(x = age, y = dep_delay_mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous("Age of plane (years)", breaks = seq(0, 30, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Mean Departure Delay (minutes)")
```

-   There is a similar relationship in arrival delays. The delays
    increase with the age of the plane until ten years, then it declines
    and flattens out.

``` r
ggplot(plane_new, aes(x = age, y = arr_delay_mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous("Age of Plane (years)", breaks = seq(0, 30, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Mean Arrival Delay (minutes)")
```
